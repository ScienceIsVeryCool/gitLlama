gitllama is a meta aware sysytem. it should be aware of things going on, like what stage it is on, etc. It should be able to give executive summary.


We need to have congress be feed all previous messages but truncated to fit context window


tell it to assume we are not sudo

maybe diverge the project completely so that this is making python code exclusively and that it has to run containerized code and test it and all that jazz. Congress is actually just a big code review sesh or something or stays as is. idk. 
But i like the idea of making this just a tool which makes python code which is containerized to do all that jazz and what not all from just an empty git repo which has a TODO.md which describes whatever user input needs to be translated into a python application. We can fork the project here maybe and just call this TODO.md or idk. TODOllama.... ah man. and still ONLY support ollama. love open source bitch. If there is an arbitrary way of doing the python process, then hard code what we think is best. like podman vs docker just decide and hard code those actions and keep the same exact process. The idea is that we make this look at main, or whatever is available with a TODO.md file describing user input then we can make a python app to do that thing.
