## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

## Project Files

*   `src/student.py` - Contains the Student class and related methods for managing student data and calculating GPAs.
*   `src/gradebook.py` - Contains the grade conversion constants and potentially supporting functions.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)

### `student.py`

*   **Class and Course Structure:**
    *   Implements the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.
    *   Implements the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and `grade` (initially None).
*   **Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implements the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
*   **Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implements the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.

### `gradebook.py`
*   **Grade Conversion Constants:** Creates this file to house all grade conversion factors.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differences in weighting, and any other relevant conversion factors.

## Constants File (Example)

```python
# constants.py
GRADE_WEIGHTINGS = {
    "Regular": 1.0,
    "Honors": 1.2,
    "AP": 1.5
}

                        <div style="color: #374151; line-height: 1.6; white-space: pre-wrap;">## Analysis of Test Results and TODO Implementation Success

**1. Overall Assessment: Not Successful**

Based on the provided information – a test exit code of 1 accompanied by the “sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts” output – the TODO implementation was *not* successful. This indicates a fundamental problem with the application’s security configuration or authentication setup, rather than a successful implementation of the intended functionality. The test suite failed to execute, and the reason for the failure points to a misconfigured security setting.

**2. What Worked Correctly (If Anything)**

It’s difficult to definitively state what *worked* correctly given the failure of the test suite. However, the existence of the numerous files suggests a reasonably structured project. We can assume:

*   **Project Structure:** The project follows a standard structure with separate modules for `student`, `course`, `gradebook`, and a main application (`main.py`).  This indicates a degree of organization.
*   **Testing Framework:** The use of `pytest` (as indicated by `main.pytest.ini`) demonstrates a commitment to automated testing, a positive practice.
*   **Version Control:** The presence of files like `src/requirements.txt` suggests a dependency management system is in place, potentially utilizing `pip` to manage Python dependencies.
*   **Build and Deployment Scripts:**  The `build.sh` and `deploy.sh` scripts suggest an automated build and deployment process, although their functionality isn't demonstrated by the test failure.
*   **Documentation:** The `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore` files establish basic project documentation and repository access control.

**3. What Failed or Had Issues**

The primary issue is the failing test suite. The "sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts" output is a critical indicator. This suggests one or more of the following:

*   **Incorrect Credentials:** The application is attempting to run with incorrect credentials (username and/or password). This is the most probable cause.
*   **Authentication Configuration:** The application’s authentication mechanism is not properly configured. This could involve a faulty `auth.py` or similar file, or a misconfiguration within `main.py` that is triggering the attempt to run as root.
*   **Root User Access:** The application is attempting to operate with elevated privileges (root) unnecessarily. This can be a security risk.
*   **Environment Variables:** The application might be relying on environment variables to specify credentials or permissions, and those variables are either missing or incorrectly set.

The test suite failing *completely* suggests a broader problem than a single test. It is highly likely the root cause is affecting the application’s startup process.

**4. Specific Recommendations for Fixes**

Here’s a prioritized list of recommendations for addressing this issue:

1.  **Investigate Authentication Configuration:** The *most critical* step is to thoroughly review the authentication setup. This includes:
    *   `main.py`:  Examine how the application attempts to authenticate.  Are credentials being read from environment variables, a configuration file, or directly coded into the script?
    *   `config.py`:  Inspect this file for any configuration related to authentication.
    *   `auth.py` (if it exists):  Analyze this file to understand the authentication logic.
2.  **Review Environment Variables:** Verify that any environment variables used for authentication are set correctly.  Ensure they contain the correct username and password. Use a secure method for setting environment variables (e.g., `.env` file with proper security practices, or secure shell configuration).
3. **Correct Password Attempts:** Determine the correct password. The error indicates the wrong credentials are being used when starting the application.
4.  **Security Audit:** Conduct a basic security audit to ensure the application isn't attempting to run with unnecessary root privileges.
5.  **Review Test Setup:** Confirm the testing environment itself is correctly configured. Are the test credentials appropriate for the test environment? 
6. **Fix Test Dependencies:**  Check if tests require root privileges and whether this is appropriate.

**5. Confidence Level in Assessment (0-100%)**

**Confidence Level: 40%**

The low confidence level is due to the fact that the test failure points to a fundamental problem (incorrect credentials) rather than a specific code defect.  The “sudo” output provides a very clear indication of the issue, but without further investigation, it’s difficult to determine the exact root cause within the application’s code.  A more detailed log analysis or debugging session would significantly increase the confidence level.

**Further Investigation Recommendations:**

*   **Detailed Logs:** Examine application logs for more specific error messages related to authentication.
*   **Debugging Session:**  A debugging session, running the application with a debugger attached, would allow for step-by-step inspection of the authentication process.
*   **Simplified Test Case:** Create a minimal test case that only attempts to authenticate, isolating the authentication logic.</div>

                            <div class="response-content" id="response-TODO_Analysis-1">Okay, let&#x27;s analyze the `TODO.md` content in relation to the provided code context. This is a significant task, and a structured approach will ensure we address all aspects of the project requirements.

**1. Regions of Interest for TODO Items:**

Based on the `TODO.md` content, the following files are *immediately* regions of interest, demanding focused attention:

*   **`main.py`**: This file is the central entry point and demonstration code. It’s where the core functionality – loading data, calculating GPAs, generating transcripts, and handling error conditions – is executed. A substantial amount of work is expected here, particularly concerning the demonstration and testing of the entire system.  The ~150 lines suggest that the current implementation may need expansion to fully showcase all the desired features.
*   **`student.py`**: This file defines the `Student` and `Course` classes, which are the foundation of the system.  The ~300 line specification suggests there&#x27;s considerable logic within these classes that will require thorough review and potentially enhancement. Specifically, the weight calculation and the GPA calculation itself are key areas to examine.
*   **`gradebook.py`**: This file, while specified as having ~250 lines, likely contains the core logic for handling grades (weighting, conversions, etc.). This is the most likely area for complex calculation routines.

**2. Files Likely Needing Work &amp; Specific Tasks:**

Here’s a breakdown of what needs to be done in each file, prioritizing based on the `TODO.md`’s focus:

*   **`main.py`**:
    *   **Expand Demonstration:** The current implementation is a starting point. It needs to demonstrably showcase all the features outlined in the `TODO.md` – loading data, adding programmatic entries, GPA calculations (weighted &amp; unweighted), generating transcripts, class rankings, honor roll identification, valedictorian identification, and grade distribution analysis. This will likely require more data generation and additional logic.
    *   **Error Handling:** The `TODO.md` explicitly mentions demonstrating error handling. This needs robust implementation to handle potential issues like invalid grade input, missing data, and division by zero.  Add more comprehensive `try...except` blocks.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The print statements in `main.py` should be refined to produce a clear, well-formatted output, as described in the `TODO.md`.  Consider using f-strings for concise and readable output.

*   **`student.py`**:
    *   **GPA Calculation:** The core logic for calculating weighted and unweighted GPAs *must* be implemented correctly within the `Student` class. This is the most crucial task.  The classes should correctly reflect the different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) and their respective weighting factors.
    *   **Course Level Handling:** Ensure that the different course levels are correctly handled and that the correct weighting factors are applied.
    *   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation to ensure that student and course information is valid before being added to the system.

*   **`gradebook.py`**:
    *   **Grade Weighting Logic:** This file likely contains the core logic for converting grades to numerical values and applying the correct weightings based on course level.  Thoroughly review and refine this logic.
    *   **Grade Conversion:** Implement the logic for converting letter grades (A, B, C, etc.) to numerical values. This process should be configurable based on course level.

**3. Helpful Information for Implementation:**

Here’s a summary of helpful information to provide someone implementing the TODO:

*   **Data Structure:**  The `data.json` file is the source of truth for student and course data.  Understand the JSON structure thoroughly.  Document the keys used (e.g., `student_id`, `name`, `course_name`, `grade`).
*   **Weighting Factors:**  Establish clear and documented weighting factors for each course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  This is critical for accurate GPA calculation.  A table outlining these factors would be extremely helpful.
*   **Grade Conversion Table:** Provide a comprehensive table mapping letter grades to numerical values, with different values for different course levels.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Advocate for a robust testing strategy.  This should include:
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Test individual functions and methods (e.g., GPA calculation, grade conversion).
    *   **Integration Tests:** Verify that the different components of the system work together correctly.
    *   **Data Validation Tests:** Ensure that the system handles invalid data gracefully.
*   **Code Style &amp; Documentation:**  Enforce a consistent code style (e.g., PEP 8) and add comprehensive comments to explain the logic.

By focusing on these areas and providing the additional information outlined above, you will significantly increase the chances of successfully implementing the `TODO.md` and creating a fully functional student academic tracker system.</div>

                    Summarize the following analysis of how different code chunks relate to the TODO:

Okay, let&#x27;s analyze the `TODO.md` content in relation to the provided code context. This is a significant task, and a structured approach will ensure we address all aspects of the project requirements.

**1. Regions of Interest for TODO Items:**

Based on the `TODO.md` content, the following files are *immediately* regions of interest, demanding focused attention:

*   **`main.py`**: This file is the central entry point and demonstration code. It’s where the core functionality – loading data, calculating GPAs, generating transcripts, and handling error conditions – is executed. A substantial amount of work is expected here, particularly concerning the demonstration and testing of the entire system.  The ~150 lines suggest that the current implementation may need expansion to fully showcase all the desired features.
*   **`student.py`**: This file defines the `Student` and `Course` classes, which are the foundation of the system.  The ~300 line specification suggests there&#x27;s considerable logic within these classes that will require thorough review and potentially enhancement. Specifically, the weight calculation and the GPA calculation itself are key areas to examine.
*   **`gradebook.py`**: This file, while specified as having ~250 lines, likely contains the core logic for handling grades (weighting, conversions, etc.). This is the most likely area for complex calculation routines.

**2. Files Likely Needing Work &amp; Specific Tasks:**

Here’s a breakdown of what needs to be done in each file, prioritizing based on the `TODO.md`’s focus:

*   **`main.py`**:
    *   **Expand Demonstration:** The current implementation is a starting point. It needs to demonstrably showcase all the features outlined in the `TODO.md` – loading data, adding programmatic entries, GPA calculations (weighted &amp; unweighted), generating transcripts, class rankings, honor roll identification, valedictorian identification, and grade distribution analysis. This will likely require more data generation and additional logic.
    *   **Error Handling:** The `TODO.md` explicitly mentions demonstrating error handling. This needs robust implementation to handle potential issues like invalid grade input, missing data, and division by zero.  Add more comprehensive `try...except` blocks.
    *   **Output Formatting:** The print statements in `main.py` should be refined to produce a clear, well-formatted output, as described in the `TODO.md`.  Consider using f-strings for concise and readable output.

*   **`student.py`**:
    *   **GPA Calculation:** The core logic for calculating weighted and unweighted GPAs *must* be implemented correctly within the `Student` class. This is the most crucial task.  The classes should correctly reflect the different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) and their respective weighting factors.
    *   **Course Level Handling:** Ensure that the different course levels are correctly handled and that the correct weighting factors are applied.
    *   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation to ensure that student and course information is valid before being added to the system.

*   **`gradebook.py`**:
    *   **Grade Weighting Logic:** This file likely contains the core logic for converting grades to numerical values and applying the correct weightings based on course level.  Thoroughly review and refine this logic.
    *   **Grade Conversion:** Implement the logic for converting letter grades (A, B, C, etc.) to numerical values. This process should be configurable based on course level.

**3. Helpful Information for Implementation:**

Here’s a summary of helpful information to provide someone implementing the TODO:

*   **Data Structure:**  The `data.json` file is the source of truth for student and course data.  Understand the JSON structure thoroughly.  Document the keys used (e.g., `student_id`, `name`, `course_name`, `grade`).
*   **Weighting Factors:**  Establish clear and documented weighting factors for each course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  This is critical for accurate GPA calculation.  A table outlining these factors would be extremely helpful.
*   **Grade Conversion Table:** Provide a comprehensive table mapping letter grades to numerical values, with different values for different course levels.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Advocate for a robust testing strategy.  This should include:
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Test individual functions and methods (e.g., GPA calculation, grade conversion).
    *   **Integration Tests:** Verify that the different components of the system work together correctly.
    *   **Data Validation Tests:** Ensure that the system handles invalid data gracefully.
*   **Code Style &amp; Documentation:**  Enforce a consistent code style (e.g., PEP 8) and add comprehensive comments to explain the logic.

By focusing on these areas and providing the additional information outlined above, you will significantly increase the chances of successfully implementing the `TODO.md` and creating a fully functional student academic tracker system.

                            <div class="response-content" id="response-TODO_Analysis-2">Okay, here’s a comprehensive analysis of the `TODO.md` and its implications for the project, designed to guide implementation effectively:

**1. Prioritized Files &amp; Key Focus Areas:**

The most critical files to concentrate on are:

*   **`student.py`:** This is *the* foundational file.  The 300 lines suggest significant logic within the `Student` and `Course` classes.  Correct GPA calculation (weighted &amp; unweighted), handling course levels, and data validation are paramount.  Addressing these will directly impact the entire system’s functionality.
*   **`main.py`:** This file needs to be expanded to demonstrate *all* requested features – data loading, programmatically adding student records, GPA calculation, transcript generation, class ranking, honor roll identification, and grade distribution analysis.  The ~150 lines present a starting point, but a substantial expansion is necessary.
*   **`gradebook.py`:**  Given its ~250 lines, this file is crucial for managing grade conversions and applying the correct weighting factors.  A flawed implementation here will lead to incorrect GPA calculations.


**2. Key Insights &amp; Implementation Approach:**

*   **Modular Design is Essential:** The project’s structure – with separate files for `Student`, `Course`, and `Gradebook` – is good.  Maintain this modularity.  Focus on tightly integrated components rather than monolithic implementations.
*   **GPA Calculation as the Core:** The weighted and unweighted GPA calculations are the heart of the system. Invest significant time in thoroughly testing and validating this logic. Unit tests are absolutely essential here.
*   **Gradual Feature Integration:** Instead of trying to implement *everything* at once, adopt a phased approach.  Start with basic data loading, a single GPA calculation, and a simple transcript generation. Then, add more features incrementally, thoroughly testing each addition.
*   **Data Validation is Crucial:** The system *must* handle invalid data gracefully. Implement robust validation checks within the `Student` and `Course` classes to ensure data integrity.
*   **Leverage F-strings:** As suggested in the `TODO.md`, use f-strings for generating output – it significantly improves readability and maintainability.



**3. Potential Challenges &amp; Dependencies:**

*   **JSON Data Structure Complexity:** The `data.json` file likely has a nested structure. Thoroughly understanding this structure and documenting the key fields is critical.
*   **Weighting Factor Configuration:**  The accuracy of GPA calculations hinges on correctly configuring and applying weighting factors.  Having a clear, documented table of these factors is paramount to prevent errors.
*   **Grade Conversion Logic:**  The mapping between letter grades and numerical values *can* be complex, especially considering variations across course levels. Careful testing and verification are vital.
*   **Error Handling Robustness:**  The success of the project depends on a comprehensive approach to error handling. Anticipate potential issues (e.g., invalid grade input, missing data) and implement appropriate `try...except` blocks.

**4. Recommended Order of Operations:**

1.  **Data Structure &amp; Weighting Factor Definition:** Fully document and define the `data.json` structure and the weighting factors. This should be the very first step.
2.  **Basic Data Loading &amp; Validation:** Implement the code to load the `data.json` file and validate the data structure.
3.  **Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the unweighted GPA calculation within the `Student` class and thoroughly test it.
4.  **Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the weighted GPA calculation, correctly applying the weighting factors.
5.  **Grade Conversion Logic:** Implement the letter grade to numerical value conversion.
6.  **Transcript Generation:** Generate a basic transcript showing student name, courses, and unweighted/weighted GPAs.
7.  **Class Ranking &amp; Honor Roll:** Implement class ranking and honor roll calculations.
8.  **Valedictorian Identification:** Implement valedictorian identification logic.
9.  **Grade Distribution Analysis:**  Implement the code to analyze grade distributions.



By following this phased approach and paying close attention to the identified key areas, the project’s success is significantly enhanced.  Prioritizing testing throughout the development process is absolutely critical.</div>

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, identifies honor roll students, and prints a formatted transcript showing the computational results clearly.

=== SUMMARY OF CODE ANALYSIS ===
Okay, here’s a comprehensive analysis of the `TODO.md` and its implications for the project, designed to guide implementation effectively:

**1. Prioritized Files &amp; Key Focus Areas:**

The most critical files to concentrate on are:

*   **`student.py`:** This is *the* foundational file.  The 300 lines suggest significant logic within the `Student` and `Course` classes.  Correct GPA calculation (weighted &amp; unweighted), handling course levels, and data validation are paramount.  Addressing these will directly impact the entire system’s functionality.
*   **`main.py`:** This file needs to be expanded to demonstrate *all* requested features – data loading, programmatically adding student records, GPA calculation, transcript generation, class ranking, honor roll identification, and grade distribution analysis.  The ~150 lines present a starting point, but a substantial expansion is necessary.
*   **`gradebook.py`:**  Given its ~250 lines, this file is crucial for managing grade conversions and applying the correct weighting factors.  A flawed implementation here will lead to incorrect GPA calculations.

**2. Key Insights &amp; Implementation Approach:**

*   **Modular Design is Essential:** The project’s structure – with separate files for `Student`, `Course`, and `Gradebook` – is good.  Maintain this modularity.  Focus on tightly integrated components rather than monolithic implementations.
*   **GPA Calculation as the Core:** The weighted and unweighted GPA calculations are the heart of the system. Invest significant time in thoroughly testing and validating this logic. Unit tests are absolutely essential here.
*   **Gradual Feature Integration:** Instead of trying to implement *everything* at once, adopt a phased approach.  Start with basic data loading, a single GPA calculation, and a simple transcript generation. Then, add more features incrementally, thoroughly testing each addition.
*   **Data Validation is Crucial:** The system *must* handle invalid data gracefully. Implement robust validation checks within the `Student` and `Course` classes to ensure data integrity.
*   **Leverage F-strings:** As suggested in the `TODO.md`, use f-strings for generating output – it significantly improves readability and maintainability.

**3. Potential Challenges &amp; Dependencies:**

*   **JSON Data Structure Complexity:** The `data.json` file likely has a nested structure. Thoroughly understanding this structure and documenting the key fields is critical.
*   **Weighting Factor Configuration:**  The accuracy of GPA calculations hinges on correctly configuring and applying weighting factors.  Having a clear, documented table of these factors is paramount to prevent errors.
*   **Grade Conversion Logic:**  The mapping between letter grades and numerical values *can* be complex, especially considering variations across course levels. Careful testing and verification are vital.
*   **Error Handling Robustness:**  The success of the project depends on a comprehensive approach to error handling. Anticipate potential issues (e.g., invalid grade input, missing data) and implement appropriate `try...except` blocks.

**4. Recommended Order of Operations:**

1.  **Data Structure &amp; Weighting Factor Definition:** Fully document and define the `data.json` structure and the weighting factors. This should be the very first step.
2.  **Basic Data Loading &amp; Validation:** Implement the code to load the `data.json` file and validate the data structure.
3.  **Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the unweighted GPA calculation within the `Student` class and thoroughly test it.
4.  **Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the weighted GPA calculation, correctly applying the weighting factors.
5.  **Grade Conversion Logic:** Implement the letter grade to numerical value conversion.
6.  **Transcript Generation:** Generate a basic transcript showing student name, courses, and unweighted/weighted GPAs.
7.  **Class Ranking &amp; Honor Roll:** Implement class ranking and honor roll calculations.
8.  **Valedictorian Identification:** Implement valedictorian identification logic.
9.  **Grade Distribution Analysis:**  Implement the code to analyze grade distributions.

By following this phased approach and paying close attention to the identified key areas, the project’s success is significantly enhanced.  Prioritizing testing throughout the development process is absolutely critical.

                    Based on the TODO and code analysis, create a COMPREHENSIVE action plan to complete ALL tasks in the TODO file.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You MUST attempt to complete the ENTIRE TODO file, not just one task
2. Analyze EVERY item in the TODO and determine what files are needed for COMPLETE implementation
3. List ALL files that need to be created/modified/deleted to accomplish EVERYTHING in the TODO
4. For each file, describe the specific changes needed to fulfill ALL related TODO requirements
5. Create a holistic strategy that addresses ALL interconnected TODO items simultaneously
6. Define success criteria that encompasses COMPLETION of the ENTIRE TODO list
7. Suggest a branch name that reflects the comprehensive nature of ALL changes

Be exhaustive and thorough. Name EVERY file needed across the ENTIRE codebase to complete ALL TODO items.
Think systematically about dependencies - if TODO item A requires changes to files X, Y, Z, and TODO item B requires changes to files Y, Z, W, then your plan must include ALL files: X, Y, Z, W.

Your goal is TOTAL COMPLETION of the TODO file. Do not leave any TODO item unaddressed.

                            <div class="response-content" id="response-TODO_Analysis-3">Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.


**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.</div>

                    Plan excerpt: Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a

                    Based on this COMPREHENSIVE plan to complete the ENTIRE TODO, suggest a git branch name.

Rules:
- Use format: type/description (e.g., feat/complete-todo, feat/implement-all-features)
- Lowercase with hyphens
- Max 30 characters
- Reflect that this implements MULTIPLE TODO items comprehensively
- Avoid overly specific names since this covers the ENTIRE TODO

Respond with ONLY the branch name, no explanation.

                    Action Plan:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    Based on this COMPREHENSIVE action plan, list EVERY SINGLE FILE that needs to be modified, created, or deleted to COMPLETELY fulfill ALL tasks in the TODO.

CRITICAL EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST list EVERY file mentioned or implied in the plan
- Include ALL files needed for COMPLETE implementation of ALL TODO items
- List each file on a separate line
- Use relative paths from the project root (e.g., src/main.py, not ./src/main.py)
- Include ALL existing files to modify AND ALL new files to create
- If a file needs to be deleted, prefix it with &quot;DELETE: &quot;
- If a file needs to be created, prefix it with &quot;CREATE: &quot;
- If a file needs to be modified, just list the path normally
- Be EXHAUSTIVE - do not skip any files that are needed
- Include test files, configuration files, documentation files if mentioned
- Think about ALL dependencies and related files needed for full implementation

Remember: The goal is COMPLETE implementation of the ENTIRE TODO.
If the plan mentions 20 files, list ALL 20 files.
If the plan implies additional helper files are needed, list those too.

Format each line as:
filename.ext
or
CREATE: new_file.py  
or
DELETE: old_file.js

List ALL the files:

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/student.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/course.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/gradebook.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

                    VALIDATING FILE: src/main.py
OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/main.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/data.json

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/test_student.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/test_course.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/test_main.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/test_data.json

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/config.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/requirements.txt

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/README.md

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/tests/test_student.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/tests/test_gradebook.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/tests/test_main.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/tests/test_data.json

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/deploy.sh

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/.gitignore

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/main.pytest.ini

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/scripts/generate_test_data.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/scripts/update_data.py

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

OPERATION: EDIT
ORIGINAL FROM PLAN: src/report.html

=== ACTION PLAN ===
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

This represents an assumption and a deviation from a systematic approach, which I strongly oppose.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

Adding a new test file without a clear justification introduces unnecessary complexity and deviates from the prioritized, iterative approach of modular design and thorough validation, which I value significantly.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

AVAILABLE FILES (first 50):



CRITICAL: We need to complete the ENTIRE TODO file. Review the plan carefully.
Are there ANY additional files needed to FULLY complete ALL TODO items?
Think about:
- Test files for new functionality
- Configuration files that need updates
- Helper/utility files that support the main changes
- Documentation files if mentioned in TODO
- Any dependency files

Respond with the exact relative file path (e.g., &#x27;src/utils.py&#x27;) or &#x27;DONE&#x27; ONLY if you are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN all files needed for COMPLETE TODO implementation are selected.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

AVAILABLE FILES (first 50):



CRITICAL: We need to complete the ENTIRE TODO file. Review the plan carefully.
Are there ANY additional files needed to FULLY complete ALL TODO items?
Think about:
- Test files for new functionality
- Configuration files that need updates
- Helper/utility files that support the main changes
- Documentation files if mentioned in TODO
- Any dependency files

Respond with the exact relative file path (e.g., &#x27;src/utils.py&#x27;) or &#x27;DONE&#x27; ONLY if you are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN all files needed for COMPLETE TODO implementation are selected.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
Project tree not available

AVAILABLE FILES (first 50):



CRITICAL: We need to complete the ENTIRE TODO file. Review the plan carefully.
Are there ANY additional files needed to FULLY complete ALL TODO items?
Think about:
- Test files for new functionality
- Configuration files that need updates
- Helper/utility files that support the main changes
- Documentation files if mentioned in TODO
- Any dependency files

Respond with the exact relative file path (e.g., &#x27;src/utils.py&#x27;) or &#x27;DONE&#x27; ONLY if you are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN all files needed for COMPLETE TODO implementation are selected.

It provides an overly detailed file path (src/test_mainpy) without a clear justification for needing an additional file, contradicting the emphasis on a structured and iterative approach to development and the critical need to complete the ENTIRE TODO file.

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

CRITICAL: We need to complete the ENTIRE TODO file. Review the plan carefully.
Are there ANY additional files needed to FULLY complete ALL TODO items?
Think about:
- Test files for new functionality
- Configuration files that need updates
- Helper/utility files that support the main changes
- Documentation files if mentioned in TODO
- Any dependency files

Respond with the exact relative file path (e.g., &#x27;src/utils.py&#x27;) or &#x27;DONE&#x27; ONLY if you are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN all files needed for COMPLETE TODO implementation are selected.

                                            <strong>Reasoning:</strong> The response identifies `src/test_mainpy` as a needed file, but lacks the systematic, evidence-based approach I value. The prompt explicitly asks for a complete list of *all* required files, not just a single, potentially incomplete suggestion. This demonstrates a lack of thoroughness and a failure to fully consider the scope of the task.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

Suggesting `src/test_mainpy` as an additional file is a significant overreach; the provided context clearly outlines a comprehensive action plan with numerous files already selected, and a single file addition doesn't logically address the full scope of the TODO items.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

AVAILABLE FILES (first 50):



CRITICAL: We need to complete the ENTIRE TODO file. Review the plan carefully.
Are there ANY additional files needed to FULLY complete ALL TODO items?
Think about:
- Test files for new functionality
- Configuration files that need updates
- Helper/utility files that support the main changes
- Documentation files if mentioned in TODO
- Any dependency files

Respond with the exact relative file path (e.g., &#x27;src/utils.py&#x27;) or &#x27;DONE&#x27; ONLY if you are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN all files needed for COMPLETE TODO implementation are selected.

                    COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN FOR ENTIRE TODO:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differentiated by course level (Regular, Honors, AP).  Example:
    ```python
    # gradebook.py
    HONORS_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 2.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }
    AP_WEIGHTING = {
        &#x27;A&#x27;: 5.0,
        &#x27;B&#x27;: 4.0,
        &#x27;C&#x27;: 3.0,
        &#x27;D&#x27;: 1.0,
        &#x27;F&#x27;: 0.0
    }

    ```

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Data Loading:** Update the data loading section to properly instantiate `Student` and `Course` objects from the `data.json` file.
    *   **Task 2: Print GPA Calculations:** Add print statements to display the calculated unweighted and weighted GPAs for each student.

**Phase 2: Transcript Generation &amp; Analysis (Estimated Time: 2-3 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Generate Transcript:** Implement the functionality to generate a formatted transcript for each student, displaying their name, courses, unweighted GPA, and weighted GPA.
    *   **Task 2: Class Ranking:** Implement logic to calculate and display the class rank for each student.
    *   **Task 3: Honor Roll Identification:** Implement the logic to identify students who qualify for the honor roll (e.g., top 10% or top GPA).
*   **File: `student.py`** – *Minor Modifications*
     * **Task 1: Add Honor Roll Status:** Add a `honor_roll_status` attribute to the Student object to track this.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features &amp; Refinement (Estimated Time: 1-2 Days)**

*   **File: `main.py`** – *Moderate Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Valedictorian Identification:** Implement the logic to identify the valedictorian (student with the highest GPA).
    *   **Task 2: Grade Distribution Analysis:** Implement the code to analyze the grade distribution within each course level (Regular, Honors, AP) and display the results.
*   **File:  `data.json`** - *Update:*  Add `honor_roll_status` field to all student records.

**Overall Success Criteria:**

*   All TODO items are completed.
*   The system successfully loads data from the `data.json` file.
*   The GPA calculations (weighted and unweighted) are accurate.
*   The transcript generation functionality is fully functional.
*   The class ranking, honor roll, and valedictorian identification logic are correct.
*   The grade distribution analysis is performed correctly.
*   All output is formatted as specified.
*   All code is well-documented and adheres to good coding practices.

**Branch Name Suggestion:**  `feature/student-academic-tracker` – Reflects the core feature implementation.

**Reasoning and Key Decisions:**

*   **Modular Design:** The initial structure (separate files for student, course, and grade conversion) is essential for maintainability and scalability.
*   **Centralized Constants:** Using `gradebook.py` for grade conversion factors ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
*   **Iterative Development:** Starting with the core calculations and then building out the more complex features allows for early validation and reduces the impact of debugging.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Unit tests should be written for the GPA calculation and the grade conversion logic.

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the `TODO.md` project.  It’s a detailed and structured approach designed to ensure the system’s success. Remember, regular testing and iteration are crucial throughout the development process.

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

## Project Files

*   `src/student.py` - Contains the Student class and related methods for managing student data and calculating GPAs.
*   `src/gradebook.py` - Contains the grade conversion constants and potentially supporting functions.

## Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)

### `student.py`

*   **Class and Course Structure:**
    *   Implements the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.
    *   Implements the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and `grade` (initially None).
*   **Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implements the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
*   **Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implements the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.

### `gradebook.py`
*   **Grade Conversion Constants:** Creates this file to house all grade conversion factors.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, differences in weighting, and any other relevant conversion factors.

## Constants File (Example)

```python
# constants.py
GRADE_WEIGHTINGS = {
    &quot;Regular&quot;: 1.0,
    &quot;Honors&quot;: 1.2,
    &quot;AP&quot;: 1.5
}
```

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements.

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

# TODO.md - Student Academic Tracker System

## Project Overview
Create a Python application that manages student academic records, calculates GPAs (weighted and unweighted), generates transcripts, and identifies academic achievements. The system should handle different course levels (Regular, Honors, AP) with appropriate grade weighting and provide clear console output showing all calculations.

**Success Criteria**: Running the program successfully loads sample data, calculates correct GPAs, i

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
Okay, let’s tackle the complete implementation of the `TODO.md` project. Given the scope, this will be a multi-stage approach, focusing on modularity and iterative development. Here’s a comprehensive action plan, including file modifications and detailed reasoning:

**Phase 1: Foundation &amp; Core Calculations (Estimated Time: 3-5 Days)**

*   **File: `student.py`** – *Major Modifications*
    *   **Task 1: Class and Course Structure:**  Implement the `Student` class with attributes like `student_id`, `name`, `courses` (a list of `Course` objects), and basic methods for adding/removing courses.  Implement the `Course` class with attributes like `course_id`, `name`, `level` (Regular, Honors, AP), `credits`, and the `grade` (initially None).
    *   **Task 2: Weighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_weighted_gpa()` method within the `Student` class. This will take the `courses` list and calculate the weighted GPA based on the level and associated weighting factors (defined in a constants file – see below).
    *   **Task 3: Unweighted GPA Calculation:** Implement the `calculate_unweighted_gpa()` method in the `Student` class. This will return the unweighted GPA as a simple average of the numerical grades.
*   **File: `gradebook.py`** – *Creation*
    *   **Task 1: Grade Conversion Constants:** Create this file to house all grade conversion factors. This centralizes the values and makes changes easier.  Include a dictionary mapping letter grades to numerical values, dif

**1. Overall Assessment: Not Successful**

Based on the provided information – a test exit code of 1 accompanied by the “sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts” output – the TODO implementation was *not* successful. This indicates a fundamental problem with the application’s security configuration or authentication setup, rather than a successful implementation of the intended functionality. The test suite failed to execute, and the reason for the failure points to a misconfigured security setting.


**2. What Worked Correctly (If Anything)**

It’s difficult to definitively state what *worked* correctly given the failure of the test suite. However, the existence of the numerous files suggests a reasonably structured project. We can assume:

*   **Project Structure:** The project follows a standard structure with separate modules for `student`, `course`, `gradebook`, and a main application (`main.py`).  This indicates a degree of organization.
*   **Testing Framework:** The use of `pytest` (as indicated by `main.pytest.ini`) demonstrates a commitment to automated testing, a positive practice.
*   **Version Control:** The presence of files like `src/requirements.txt` suggests a dependency management system is in place, potentially utilizing `pip` to manage Python dependencies.
*   **Build and Deployment Scripts:**  The `build.sh` and `deploy.sh` scripts suggest an automated build and deployment process, although their functionality isn&#x27;t demonstrated by the test failure.
*   **Documentation:** The `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore` files establish basic project documentation and repository access control.

**3. What Failed or Had Issues**

The primary issue is the failing test suite. The &quot;sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts&quot; output is a critical indicator. This suggests one or more of the following:

*   **Incorrect Credentials:** The application is attempting to run with incorrect credentials (username and/or password). This is the most probable cause.
*   **Authentication Configuration:** The application’s authentication mechanism is not properly configured. This could involve a faulty `auth.py` or similar file, or a misconfiguration within `main.py` that is triggering the attempt to run as root.
*   **Root User Access:** The application is attempting to operate with elevated privileges (root) unnecessarily. This can be a security risk.
*   **Environment Variables:** The application might be relying on environment variables to specify credentials or permissions, and those variables are either missing or incorrectly set.

The test suite failing *completely* suggests a broader problem than a single test. It is highly likely the root cause is affecting the application’s startup process.



**4. Specific Recommendations for Fixes**

Here’s a prioritized list of recommendations for addressing this issue:

1.  **Investigate Authentication Configuration:** The *most critical* step is to thoroughly review the authentication setup. This includes:
    *   `main.py`:  Examine how the application attempts to authenticate.  Are credentials being read from environment variables, a configuration file, or directly coded into the script?
    *   `config.py`:  Inspect this file for any configuration related to authentication.
    *   `auth.py` (if it exists):  Analyze this file to understand the authentication logic.
2.  **Review Environment Variables:** Verify that any environment variables used for authentication are set correctly.  Ensure they contain the correct username and password. Use a secure method for setting environment variables (e.g., `.env` file with proper security practices, or secure shell configuration).
3. **Correct Password Attempts:** Determine the correct password. The error indicates the wrong credentials are being used when starting the application.
4.  **Security Audit:** Conduct a basic security audit to ensure the application isn&#x27;t attempting to run with unnecessary root privileges.
5.  **Review Test Setup:** Confirm the testing environment itself is correctly configured. Are the test credentials appropriate for the test environment? 
6. **Fix Test Dependencies:**  Check if tests require root privileges and whether this is appropriate.

**5. Confidence Level in Assessment (0-100%)**

**Confidence Level: 40%**

The low confidence level is due to the fact that the test failure points to a fundamental problem (incorrect credentials) rather than a specific code defect.  The “sudo” output provides a very clear indication of the issue, but without further investigation, it’s difficult to determine the exact root cause within the application’s code.  A more detailed log analysis or debugging session would significantly increase the confidence level.



**Further Investigation Recommendations:**

*   **Detailed Logs:** Examine application logs for more specific error messages related to authentication.
*   **Debugging Session:**  A debugging session, running the application with a debugger attached, would allow for step-by-step inspection of the authentication process.
*   **Simplified Test Case:** Create a minimal test case that only attempts to authenticate, isolating the authentication logic.</div>
